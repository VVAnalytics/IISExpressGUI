## Introduction

This project is a GUI for IISExpress, born to provide an easy way to start/stop web sites managed via IISExpress and to add new Web Sites to IISExpress configuration.

It can be useful if you don't want to open a command line or Visual Studio to run IISExpress or if you want to configure a web site to be run with IISExpress without opening Visual Studio.

It's a WPF application written in C# and it provides the following features:


- Add new WebSite
- Modify existing WebSite configuration
- Start/Stop WebSite

The first release only supports:

- Http protocol
- localhost
